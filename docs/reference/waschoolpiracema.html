Every year, the school's principals, headteachers, or the person in charge must reply to a self-reported survey sent by the INEP. The questionnaire contains 62 questions and should be filled out between June and August, considering the last Wednesday of May as the reference date for data collection (INEP, 2021). The final results are released at the end of January and the beginning of February from the following year. For the year 2020, due to the extraordinary situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reference date for collecting the data was postponed to March 11 2020, one day before the national closure of schools was established. Hence, the 2020 BNSC dataset describes the state of schools' infrastructure in Brazil right before they were closed. For 2021 and 2022, the reference date for data collection returned to the original standard (last Wednesday of May of 2021 and 2022). Thus, the 2021 BNSC, which were released on February 18 2022 reflect the impacts of the pandemic and the school closure on the state of schools' infrastructure in Brazil, while the 2022 BNSC released on and February 08 2023 indicates the situation of schools at the end of the pandemic.
